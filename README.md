Path of Exile Superfilter
----------

A preprocessor for Path of Exile loot filters that adds variables, mixins, arithmetics and lots
of other useful things to GGG's loot filter syntax and compiles filters
written in the extended syntax down to a pure loot filter that can be used
in the game.

```
Usage:
  superfilter <name> [--output=<file>]
  superfilter (-h | --help)
  superfilter --version
```

Check out the [syntax documentation](doc/syntax.md) to get started.
